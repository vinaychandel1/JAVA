<p>Thread Class vs Runnable Interface 
<br>
1.)If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
<br>2.)We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
<br>3.)Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads. </p>
